%% -----------------------------------------------------------------
COSMETIC:

* unify underscores and capitalization in naming!

* add a firstFigNum parameter, and display figures starting with this number (useful for comparing results with two different sets of parameters).

%% -----------------------------------------------------------------
SMALL IMPROVEMENTS:

* thresholds should be relative to MEAN amplitudes over electrodes, not SUM.

* Consistency of thresholding test for spikes/noise: why are these all different?
   - whitening section uses cross-channel norm for determining noise chunks
   - clustering uses joint channel-time norm for grabbing spike segments
   - CBP chunking done using yet another windowed norm
  EITHER explain why their different (and use separate parameters), or make them the same! 

* threshold for choosing snippets for clustering is currently 4*std(data_magnitude) ???
  where did this come from?

* num_waveforms should be a general parameter, not in clustering

* data file should include a t0 (time of initial sample) and all times should be relative to that

* filtering.pad should be set to max of order and waveform_len

* filtering lags should be corrected, so time axis is not shifted!!
