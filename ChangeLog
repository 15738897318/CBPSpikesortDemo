	* spikesort_demo/load_default_parameters.m: 
	- Moved num_waveforms back into clustering section (hadn't realized
	there was a separate one for CBP!)

	- Moved default partitioning parameters into here.

2014-07-05  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@elvira.cns.nyu.edu>

	* spikesort_demo/load_raw_data.m: 
	Changed default Quiroga filtering.freq back to []

	Current results on Quiroga dataset 1, with waveforms re-fit twice,
	and threshold of cell 1 slightly hand-adjusted to eliminate
	refractory violations:
	Spike counts: [1921;1473;1138]
	Clustering: Misses=241/3477 (6.93%) FPs=1531/4767 (32.12%)
	       CBP: Misses=3/3477 (0.09%) FPs=2/3476 (0.06%)
	
	
2014-07-03  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@olympia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* spikesort_demo/spikesort_demo_setup.m: 
	error-protected the call to matlabpool, so that it now just gives
	a warning.

	* spikesort_demo/preproc/PreprocessTrace.m (noise_zone_idx): 
	noise_threshold parameter moved from general to whitening section.

	* spikesort_demo/load_raw_data.m: 
	- re-organized loading of data files and specialization of
	parameters.  Now it's all done in this single function, which
	replaces load_data_defaults.m

	* spikesort_demo/load_default_parameters.m: 
	added plotting.first_fig_num, and changed all display code to use
          	figure numbers offset from this number
	default fontsize changed to 12
	num_waveforms parameter moved from clustering to general section

	* spikesort_demo/preproc/plotting/VisualizeClustering.m (nh): 
	plot noise ball

	* spikesort_demo/preproc/EstimateInitialWaveforms.m (threshold): 
	>>> changed threshold for choosing segments for clustering  to 
	mean + 4*std of a chi distribution (about 3.9)

	* ToDo and ChangeLog:  moved to main directory
	* spikesort_demo/preproc/PreprocessTrace.m (nchan): 
	only plot cross-corr  for multi-channel recordings
	Display: fig3: histogram of norms, with threshold
                      fig4: ACF of noise regions
                      fig5: cross-channel correlations, but only if more than one channel!
                      fig6: noise distribution, compared with Gaussian and Laplacian
	
2014-07-02  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@olympia.cns.nyu.edu>
		
	* cbp_spikesort_demo_script.m: 
	- moved top-level description text into README.md file. Added ecos
   	   citation, and  brief outline of algorithm.
	- fixed bug: reweight_exp - this used to be hardcoded to three
	   entries
	- further cleanup in plotting of histograms of filtered data

2014-07-01  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@olympia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* load_data_defaults.m: 
	-added 100Hz cutoff to Quiroga dataset

	* cbp_spikesort_demo_script.m (dataMag): 
	- indicate filtering cutoffs in frequency plot
	- plot chi2 distribution for comparison to data magnitude

	* preproc/FilterData.m (Wn): allow params.filtering.freq to have a
	single entry (low-freq cutoff) for a high-pass filter.

2014-06-19  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@olympia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* preproc/PreprocessTrace:
	- moved mean subtraction, and global rescaling operations into FilterData.m
	- got rid of optional argument parsing for handling plot options, and used params.general.plot_diagnostics instead 
	
	
2014-06-12  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@olympia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* cbp_spikesort_demo_script:
	- rewrote comments to describe algorithm steps
	- added diagnotistic figures for filtering / whitening
	- added plots of Fourier magnitudes
	- added comments indicating what to verify in plots, and how to adjust parameters if needed
	
	* load_default_parameters:
	- added general.plot_diagnostics

	* preproc/FilterData
	- pad_size -> pad
	- freq_range -> freq
